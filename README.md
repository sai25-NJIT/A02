In this readme file, I will be providing a step by step tutorial on how to set up Git, Github, and Webstorm. Firstly, Github is a platform for users to collaborate with each other on repositories of their choosing. Git is a source control management where a user can manage changes to files over time. Webstorm is an integrated development environment for coding in JavaScript. To get started with GitHub and Git, first install Git from the internet if your machine doesn't already have it installed. GitHub utilizes Git as the actual version control system so they are used together. After installing Git, the next step is to create a GitHub account. Once done, connect your GitHub account to your Git account. In the Git terminal, type: git config --global user.name " ", where in the open quotes you type your username that you want. Next, you want to set your Git email by typing: git config --global user.email " ", where in the open quotes you type the email that you want. Then you will be asked to authenticate your GitHub account so just sing in with the same email to confirm. From here, you will be able to create and edit your code files locally. One of the main uses of GitHub is creating repositories, which are folders filled with code, and this can be done by clicking the + sign at the top right corner. The last main thing one should know about how to use Git and GitHub is that you can push your local code to GitHub. This can be done by using the code editor built-in terminal from Git. Input the commands that will be provided below after the other in the terminal and press the enter key after each command input. (NOTE: Capitalized words are for the user's personal input) 
- â€Œecho "# sample-code" >> README.md
- git init
- git add .
- git commit -m "first commit"
- git branch -M main
- git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/WHATEVERFOLDERYOUWANT
- git push -u origin main
  
There are many Git commands that a user is able to use in the terminal. Here I will provide common commands and a description of what they do.
- git init: intializes Git your folder
- git add Readme.md: adds a Readme file
- git add. : adds all files in the present folder
- git commit: stores the added files
- git branch: creates a new branch which is a new version of the repository as it appears when added
- git remote add origin: connects the local folder to the repository on GitHub
- git push -u origin main: pushes the code to GitHub

To use Webstorm, first download Webstorm from the internet. Afterwards, you can experiment with Webstorm and see its many features, but there are 4 main things that a user can do in Webstorm. The first thing a user can do is open a project. To do this, locate the Welcome Screen, click Open and then select the folder with your application in teh dialog that opens. Another thing a user can do is check out a project. First click Get from VCS on the Welcome Screen
